# installLibfreenect2
Install libfreenect2 on a Jetson Development Kit. libfreenect2 is an open source driver for Microsoft Kinect V2.

This repository constains a convenience script to install the prerequisites for building libfreenect and building the library.

<b>Note:</b> There is a difference between the stock libfreenect2 library and the one being installed here. This installation adds a patch to the the example "Protonect.cpp" file. The JPEG decompressor on the Jetson produces RGBA format, where as the viewer consumes BGRA format. The patch adds a simplistic algorithm to rearrange the bytes appropriately. 

If you plan to use this library in production code, your application should consider writing specialized code to do the RGBAâ†’BGRA conversion more efficiently.
